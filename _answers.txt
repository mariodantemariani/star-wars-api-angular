1. What's a closure? Where in the code is there a closure?
 A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. 
 In my code, there are two functions that can be called as a 'clousures': getPlanets and getPlanetsByPage functions. 
 These functions have access to the baseUrl and resourcePlanets variables defined in the outer function.

2. Which are the potential side-effects in any function? Could you point out any of these cases in your code? Are they expected? Can they be avoided?
Some potential side effects in a function include modifying global state, modifying external variables, and making asynchronous calls. 
To avoid potential side effects, it is generally recommended to write pure functions that do not modify state outside of their own scope.
- In the code, is there a  potential side effect when I make an HTTP request using the http service. This is expected behavior for an API service and cannot be avoided if you want to retrieve data from an external source. 
- In additional to that, I recommend to use external files where you can write your URLs (in this case baseUrl and resourcePlanets) and mark them as readOnly to avoid accidantaly re-writing the URLs.
